 <h2> Peprime Affiliate and partner Program </h2> 
 <p>  When you work with 
us, it makes you an international crude oil and gas consultant immediately 
and you can earn millions of dollars selling our services for yourself 
and business. This is why you have to get started now. We have established 
several international crude oil and gas agents worldwide.
Peprime core value is integrity. We insist our affiliates/partners/<wbr>consultants 
ask any seller to simply send his letter of allocation from appropriate 
agency. For example, for BLCO we ask any seller to simply send his letter 
of allocation from NNPC Crude Oil Marketing Department, which is normally 
an OPEC allocation and our buyers will sign any SPA. If they cannot 
give you this one piece of evidence that they do have a genuine allocation 
from NNPC, simply let them go. Your name is all that you have in this 
business and you must do everything to protect it. To re-emphasize our 
stand, we need only real sellers of Nigerian Crude Oil who can show their allocation
letter from NNPC Crude Oil Marketing Department Abuja. If you do not 
have this letter from the above agency only, please do not bother contacting
us.

Our Affiliate and partner Program is pure and simple. </p>

<p> Here is how it works: </p>
<p> 
When you refer a company to us in anyway or manner, simply send us your 
details with your bank account and the details of the company you have 
referred. We put your data and that of the company on our data base. 
 
Once the company buy any product or makes an investment through us you 
get a 10% commission of what ever Peprime makes from the sale or investment. 
If the company makes a purchase or an investment of a hundred million 
dollars and we are entitled to a commission of ten percent return on 
investment for life, it 
simply means you are entitled to ten percent of whatever Peprime makes 
for a life time and will automatically in most cases become a member 
of the board of directors of the newly formed company for life. 
However you have the responsibility to follow up on the client you have 
referred both directly and indirectly until a contract has been signed. 
 
We sign a non disclosure and non circumvention agreement and we also 
sign 
a contract with you prior to the investment being made.
