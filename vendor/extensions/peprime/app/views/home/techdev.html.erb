  <h2> Technology Development</h2>
        <p>Peprime Innovation and Integrated Product &amp; Technology Development service focuses on the creative aspects of engineering, and serves as a means for our clients to explore and develop novel ideas and product prototypes based on applications driven research.&nbsp;Our experienced team are endowed with a sound technology development strategy which is vital in the successful commercialization of any product, whether complex or not.&nbsp; Our expertise covers all stages of an evolving product during its development process. We place the benefit of our academic and practical experience in matters of technology development, management and strategy that cover external factors such as intellectual property issues, planned technology evolution, product architecture selection, strategic knowledge protection, and outsourcing strategy, as well as often overlooked internal factors such as knowledge management, process evolution and management of competencies at the disposal of our clients.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>We focus on the application of existing new technologies to new product and process ideas enables us to put innovation within reach of smaller companies that do not have the means to support their own development programs by avoiding the cost of basic research typically conducted by academic institutions and the largest companies. For companies that do not want to be left behind by the innovation of their competitors, but cannot justify the cost of an in house department, this approach offers an ideal way to have a cost effective development team on call.&nbsp; These clients are typically small firms or firms that have long product cycles and do not require a full time development department but at the same time cannot afford to lose sight of technological evolution.</p>
                      <p>Peprime offers integrated service which covers the entire stages in the field of Technology Development, Management and Strategy. Our services are innovative and focused on achieving cost effective solutions for its clients.</p>
                      <p>This service is provided by leveraging a global network of expertise that enables Peprime to be extremely responsive and flexible, while maintaining a global reach. Peprime's Technology Development, Management and Strategy service is offered through specific areas of expertise organized into principal services that can be applied as an integral package or as standalone components, depending on the scope of the client's requirements.</p>
                      <p>Peprime has extended its network and works with partners in various parts of the world.&nbsp; This networked model enables Peprime to offer a wide range of engineering and technology development cum management services while maintaining a high level of efficiency as well as a global reach. Peprime's core business is based on the provision of technical consulting services focused on managing and solving all stages of technology development and engineering problems spanning conceptual, basic, detailed design and development. By working with our partners, Peprime is also able to address all stages of technology and engineering development problems whether in relation to innovated technology sitting in laboratory shelves, prototype and industrial plant development.</p>
                      <p>Our experience developed in this field enable us relies on a thorough understanding of the process required to turn an idea into a prototype, along with intimate knowledge of the project management, technology management and business planning aspects that are critically important to the successful launch of an idea. Peprime's knowledge of intellectual property protection issues and strategies, and its ability to advise its clients in this regard also provides an added benefit.</p>
                      <p>In cases where the client is already clear on the technical design and help in developing the technology itself is not required, Peprime is able to provide technology management and strategy advice.&nbsp; This service would consider the technology development process and strategies for evolution and transition of the technology in order to maintain a competitive advantage.</p>
                      <p>Peprime offers an integrated project management service that is tailored to the client's requirements by drawing on all of the expertise and knowledge available within our network.&nbsp; Our service potentially span the full gamut of engineering and management functions associated with the development of a new product or technology which give our prospective clients the same confidence we have in our own capabilities.</p>
                      <p align="justify" class="style5">While innovation and prototyping is only a small part of the product development process, we understand that it is in this creative phase that our clients often need help and new ideas from outside of their environment.&nbsp; Our activity in a wide variety of fields provides an excellent means for cross fertilization of ideas and technology transfer that can result in significant product advances.<br>
                        Engaged in this role, we would typically focus on:</p>

                      <p>Peprime offer this service as standalone, but can also form part of a complete turnkey approach where required, which would extend to the detailed engineering and functional prototype development of the concept, ultimately to end with a production prototype supported by a technology and intellectual property strategy and production process plan.</p>
                      <p>Moreover, our team showcases an in depth knowledge of the technology, organization and market, as well as an ability for objective and honest evaluation to begin with.&nbsp; Peprime captures all, whether planning a strategy for a single technology or a whole organization's product portfolio it is critical to understand the dynamics of the process of technology development and evolution and the forces that shape that evolution.&nbsp;Peprime know that it is important to understand how profitability changes as technologies mature, when technologies are mature and how to recognize potentially disruptive developments, both from within and outside the organization.&nbsp; This enables decisions to be made on investments in technological development and product evolution.&nbsp; We know that understanding the process of technology adoption and diffusion through the markets plays an important part in developing the product strategy and actively managing the development cycle.</p>
                      <p>We offer guidance in the development of a comprehensive strategy as a consulting service in its own right, but we can also perform this service as an integral part of an innovation and prototyping engagement to a level appropriate for making strategic development and design decisions.&nbsp; In our technology and strategy developments we apply tried and tested analysis methods as well as more innovative system dynamics methods, based on control theory, designed to model and understand the dynamics of business systems.
